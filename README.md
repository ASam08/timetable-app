## Self-Hosting with Docker

> [!CAUTION]
> This app is not yet at version 1.0.0 and is in active development. As such, there may be breaking changes, please read release notes for any warnings and always make a backup before updating.

An `example-compose.yaml` is included to get you up and running.

**1. Copy the example config**

Create a compose.yaml file in your project folder, using the below template

```yaml
services:
  tempus_web:
    image: ghcr.io/asam08/tempus:latest
    container_name: tempus_web
    ports:
      - "3000:3000"
    depends_on:
      - tempus_db
    environment:
      NODE_ENV: production
      POSTGRES_USER: tempus # Replace this with your user
      POSTGRES_PASSWORD: tempus # Replace this with your user password
      POSTGRES_DB: tempus
      POSTGRES_PORT: 5432
      POSTGRES_HOST: tempus_db
      BETTER_AUTH_SECRET: # Run: openssl rand -base64 32
      BETTER_AUTH_URL: # set to your applications URL
      AUTH_ON: true # Change to false to remove auth, single user only
    restart: unless-stopped

  tempus_db:
    image: postgres:16-alpine
    container_name: tempus_db
    environment:
      POSTGRES_USER: tempus # Replace this with your user
      POSTGRES_PASSWORD: tempus # Replace this with your user password
      POSTGRES_DB: tempus
    volumes:
      - postgres_data:/var/lib/postgresql/data
    ports:
      - "5432:5432"
    restart: unless-stopped

volumes:
  postgres_data:
```

**2. Fill in your environment variables**

Open `compose.yaml` and adjust the environment variables. See [the enviornment variables](#environment-variables) section for more details.

Please remember to change the password from "Tempus".

_<a name="auto_approve_note"></a>Note - if you disable auto-approving new user sign-ups, you will currently have to approve users in the database itself manually. Change the "banned" field to true in the users table for the relevant user. This will be addressed in a future release._

**3. Start the app**

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

> The database schema is set up automatically as part of the Docker build.

**4. Open the app**

Visit [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) and create your account.

## Environment Variables

The following environment variables are available:

| Variable | Required? | Default | Notes |
| -------- | --------- | ------- | ----- |
| `AUTH_ON` | No | `false` | Set to `true` to enable authentication and multi-user support |
| `BETTER_AUTH_SECRET` | Yes | - | Run `openssl rand -base64 32` to generate |
| `BETTER_AUTH_URL` | Yes | - | Set to your app's base URL, e.g. `http://localhost:3000` |
| `APPROVE_SIGNUPS` | No | `false` | Set to `true` to require admin approval before new users can sign in. To approve a user, set `banned = false` and `ban_reason = NULL` in the `users` table for the relevant user. A proper admin UI for this is planned for a future release. |
